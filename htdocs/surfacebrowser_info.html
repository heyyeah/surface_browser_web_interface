  <p style="margin-top:2px;"><b>Brief</b> </p>
  <p>Surface Browser represents the cumulative experience of net surfing as a deluge of images flowing into viewer
    perception.
    The software uses browser conventions (address bar, image search and ai assistant) as entry points to a spatial
    internet.
    It can run as a stand-alone app, gallery installation with audience input and/or run autonomously based on sites and
    key words relevant to the installation.
    <!--Working on the level of the imagination (location of understanding the virtual) and experience rather 
  than as functional data interface, the piece-->
    It manifests the imagined virtual as a liquid space, remapping the static visual media of the net into an
    environment that can be entered and traversed.

    <b>Rationale</b>
  </p>
  <p>Popular evocations of technology converged in the eighties and nineties on
    the idea of cyberspace to represent the time and space inside the network and
    to encapsulate images of a data-centric, technological future. With the roll-out
    of internet technology beyond institutions to the public, many early metaphors
    related this to water: web surfing, streaming media and data pipes, with the
    mediated experience often being far from fluid! The piece looks at manifesting
    the virtual as this (blue) liquid/visceral space.</p>
  <p>Surface Browser combines this archetype of popular imagination and browser
    conventions, the address bar and an image search, as entry points to traverse
    a spatial internet in order to reflect on the user experience of browsing.
    Surface Browser remaps the visual internet into space that can be entered and
    traversed. It represents the cumulative experience of surfing the internet as
    a deluge of images flowing into viewer perception. </p>
  <p>Surface Browser works on this level of the imagination (the location of understanding
    of the virtual)* and experience rather than on a functional/programatic approach
    to a data visualisation interface. It gives volume and form to the evolving
    spaces of the internet; its semi-random paths map out arcs of potential pulling
    in the new, twisting and drawing in upon themselves, presenting an evolving
    representation of the internet and a way to explore its surfaces.</p>
  <p>The piece is written in cross-platform languages, OpenGL and Java, allowing
    it to install directly from the web and run as a standalone piece of software
    on a majority of operating systems on the viewer's computer (the context for
    viewers' reception of the internet). It employs the available technology of
    OpenGL hardware acceleration in modern gaming video cards to render in realtime
    3d. The piece can take viewer input or runs autonomously, based on sites and
    keywords relevant to the exhibition.</p>
  <p>I am interested in representing the experience of browsing the internet, exploring
    ways of looking at the pages and images which give them depth and a way to explore
    their surfaces. This is not a case of creating independent and static virtual
    3d worlds (VR, VRML) but about remapping the evolving visual aspect of the internet
    into an environment that can be entered and traversed. In this way, the solids
    representing pages can be seen as a way to give volume back to the millions
    of body images which make up so much of internet network traffic.</p>
