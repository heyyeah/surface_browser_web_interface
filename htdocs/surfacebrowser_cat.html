	<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px"> <em>&#8216;We witness the advent of the number. It comes along
			with democracy, the large city, administrations, cybernetics.
			It is a flexible and continuous mass, woven tight like a fabric
			with neither rips nor darned patches, a multitude of quantified
			heroes who lose names and faces as they become the ciphered river
			of the streets, a mobile language of computations and rationalities
			that belong to no one.&#8217; (1)<br />
		</em>Michel de Certeau</p>
	<p>Today millions of people across the globe traverse the virtual
		space of the internet. As an operational system it is one of the
		most utilised tools of communication. The language of the World
		Wide Web is complex and layered, constantly mutating into unique
		systems and structures, the absence of rules binding it to an
		amorphous understanding of space and time. Internet browsers
		such as Google&#8482;, have become essential links placed on
		desktops, acting as a doorway to the intricacies of the web,
		travelling if you like, down the various paths and codes that
		enable our questions to be miraculously explored. Internet
		browsers behave as portals to virtual space, embedded in an
		intricate matrix of language and numbers.
	</p>
	<p>French theorist Michel de Certeau was one of the first in the early
		1980s to philosophise the domestic interactions with the everyday in a
		post industrialised world of mass media and technology. His conception
		of human behaviour is made up of users or consumers of operational systems
		such as television, urban development or commerce, highlighting the
		dominant ways with which these forces shape, support and represent
		the construct by which we understand meaning. De Certeau&#8217;s examination
		of methods of operating &#8211; speech, walking, reading, sleeping, cooking &#8211;
		illustrates these acts are undertaken with the subliminal presence of
		history, memory and custom. The visual journey of popular culture
		through advertising, newspapers, television or the internet is the
		vehicle through which the act of the reader/user becomes the author/controller.
	</p>
	<p>Tim Plaisted&#8217;s &#8216;Surface Browser&#8217; is an experimental
		browser that changes the experience of the interface of the web. The user
		is confronted by a projected image of a tube-like vortex. Standing by a
		keyboard, the participant enters a web link or query which becomes a page
		that moves across the surface of the tube. &#8216;Surface Browser&#8217; pulls images
		from its search, displaying them as a kind of skin to a three dimensional
		object. This object dives through the pathways of the Web, with speed and
		direction governed by the use of a joystick console. &#8216;Surface Browser&#8217; reveals
		the results of the query through this tube, which randomly stops in a black
		weightless space of floating images. These are entry points to the
		labyrinthine matrix of the Web, acting as navigating doorways or hyperlinks
		for the user. Plaisted explains:
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px"><em>&#8216;This is not a case
			of creating independent virtual 3D worlds but about remapping the existing
			visual aspect of the internet into an environment that can be entered and
			traversed. In this way, the solids representing pages can be seen as a way
			to give volume back to the millions of body images which make up so much of
			internet network traffic.&#8217; (2)</em></p>
	<p>Extending the act of looking is a fundamental characteristic that has
		been explored in the realm of art for centuries. Acknowledging the primary
		influence of light on perceptions of reality during prehistoric times
		created a three dimensional understanding of our physical surroundings,
		which in turn was reflected in visual likenesses, whether through painting,
		sculpture or photography. The advent of the technological age has been
		equally influential in manipulating our sense of time and we are now able
		to cross hemispheres in 24 hours and send emails across the globe in seconds.
		With this derangement of time comes a rupture in our understanding of space.
		The Web&#8217;s ability to act as an encyclopaedia of limitless options is commonly
		experienced as navigating aggregate data on a flat text screen. Rather than
		attempting to provide an alternate functional paradigm to navigate net
		data / space / time, Plaisted interprets the cumulative experience of
		traversing this space as &#8216;a deluge of images flowing into viewer perception.&#8217; (3)</p>
	<p>Browser intervention is a recent exploration in new media art, one that
		Plaisted has entered from the perspective of engagement with visual social
		culture. Much of Plaisted&#8217;s earlier work such as &#8216;24hr Coverage&#8217;
		interrogated the simulated process of communicated reality. In &#8216;24hr
		Coverage&#8217;, TV news broadcasts appear as if the pause button is in
		slow gear. A newsreader is shown as if in a moment of repeated distress,
		a barely audible stammer issued from her lips as her actions are drawn out
		on screen. The absence of content is highlighted yet we understand the image
		as a vehicle through which information is divulged. Plaisted questions how
		decisions can be informed if they are &#8216;..made in terms of a
		society&#8217;s response to the events of the day without full participation
		of the public in an in-depth debate&#8217;. (4) His initial interest in
		digital/interactive media is grounded in a determination to explore its
		affects on users through interaction.</p>
	<p>The interplay of the Web could be analogous to the act of walking the
		streets of the post-modern metropolis. De Certeau comments that it is the
		people who traverse the city, creating networks and intersecting writings
		that challenge and irrevocably alter the imaginary totalisation of the
		space of the city. Internet browsers could correspond to the grid of a
		city in that they attempt to control and designate space for particular
		usage. In much the same way that a walker will choose their winding path
		consuming the visual signs of the street, Plaisted&#8217;s &#8216;Surface
		Browser&#8217; seeks to illustrate the hidden space of the internet, giving
		the anonymous user an opportunity to experience the optical voyage of a query.</p>
